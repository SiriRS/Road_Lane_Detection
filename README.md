# Road_Lane_Detection

This Python code uses OpenCV to process takes video input for lane detection. Here i have used image preprocessing techniques such as Canny edge detection and region of interest masking. The Hough Transform is used to detect and average lane lines, distinguishing between left and right lanes based on their slopes. Detected lanes are then drawn onto the frames in green. The processed frames are displayed in a window, allowing users to view the lane detection results. The script terminates when the 'q' key is pressed, releasing the video capture and closing the display window.

This model can be used for:
1.Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)
2.Autonomous vehicle systems
3.Lane departure warning systems
